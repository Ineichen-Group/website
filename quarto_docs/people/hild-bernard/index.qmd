::: {#about}
Bernard Hild, having recently completed his pre-clinical years of medicine at ETH Zürich, is now continuing his Master degree at the University of Zurich.

His love for all things related to medicine has led him into diverse settings. Whether it is engaging directly with patients as a nurse at Stadtspital Waid, providing administrative support to the University Hospital during the Covid pandemic, or delving into medical research at the STRIDE-Lab of the University of Zurich. In his projects, Bernard focuses on meta science aspects of evidence synthesis. More concretely, he is assessing a variety of quality aspects of published animal systematic reviews, including the development of methods to automatically mine such reviews to assess their quality and distribution over a larger scope.

When he is not in the lab or lecture hall, you will likely find Bernard hiking with his golden retriever along Switzerland's breathtaking trails, embarking on a road trip to explore quaint European cities, or (mostly!) gracefully gliding across the ballroom dancefloor. Feel free to interrupt him for a coffee break, to discuss a thought-provoking systematic review, or to admire a particularly striking H&E slide.

Bernard has joined the STRIDE-lab as research assistant in February 2023.
