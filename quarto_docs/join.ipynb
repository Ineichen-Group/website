        "Dr. Crump has mentored students interested in cognition at all levels, including [undergraduate, master's, doctoral, and postdoctoral researchers](https://crumplab.com/People.html). The lab is always looking for students interested in human cognition (how people think, learn, remember, attend, etc.), and who want to gain research experience by learning computational techniques for running experiments and analyzing data. This page describes current opportunities for prospective students at the undergraduate, master's, doctoral levels. Interested students should also [read some of the lab publications](https://crumplab.github.io/publications/) to learn more about the research questions we are asking.\n",

        "It is possible to gain research experience as an undergraduate at Brooklyn College, and the skills gained through these experiences can open doors for career opportunities, including pursuing advanced degrees. Dr. Crump is especially interested in mentoring students through the process of completing an undergraduate honor's thesis in their senior year ([see here for departmental requirements](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/naturalsciences/undergraduate/psychology/students/honors.php)). However, students interested in pursuing an honor's thesis should get lab experience before their final year.\n",
        "\n",
        "The honor's thesis consists of two semesters of Independent Research (e.g., Psych 5001 and 5002) and culminates in writing a thesis covering the research conducted over the year. The honor's thesis option is a great opportunity for students interested in pursuing research in a Ph.D. program following undergraduate studies. The honor's thesis is a major commitment in time and effort for everyone involved, and interested students need to plan ahead.\n",

        "The Master's of Arts in Experimental Psychology is a two-year research focused master's program at Brooklyn College. The program website describes general information about the program. Students in the program conduct research with a faculty mentor over two years culminating in a thesis. Master's students in the computational cognition lab will work with Dr. Crump over two years to complete a research project in cognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Students will learn advanced statistics, data-analysis, and computational modelling skills, and apply them to research questions in cognition. Students will also learn how to create, conduct, and analyze online behavioral experiments. The degree is typically completed in two years, by taking three courses per semester. Each semester one of the courses involves independent reading and research in the lab. In the first semester, students will acquire sub-domain expertise about a cognitive phenomena through an extensive literature review. The literature review will suggest new directions for empirical work. The second semester of independent research will involve proposals for experiments, and collection of pilot data. By, the second year students should have a well-developed research project that will form the basis for their thesis. Master's student research projects can also be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\n",
