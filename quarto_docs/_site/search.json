    "text": "Our main goal is to improve how therapies move from animal studies to early clinical trials and finally, to regulatory approval in the field of neuroscience. To achieve this, we use methods like systematic reviews and meta-analysis alongside data science techniques, including natural language processing. By identifying the key elements that lead to successful therapy translation, we aim to streamline therapy development. This would not only benefit welfare of experimental animals but also deliver better treatments to patients more efficiently."

We place an emphasis on the complete scientific cycle: from the initial study conception to the publication stage. Our goal is for you to see this whole cycle, including the development of your writing skills and the successful publication of your findings.\nMoreover, our lab has a focus on the principles of Open Science. We aim to make our research outputs fully transparent and accessible to all, thereby enhancing our impact on the scientific community and beyond."

    "text": "New paper in eBioMedicine!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe analyzed animal studies of drugs approved for treating multiple sclerosis in humans and compared them to drugs that failed in clinical trials. Could the animal data have predicted which drugs would succeed in humans? Surprisingly, over 90 percent of animal experiments were published after regulatory approval for these drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. Great work, Ingrid! Read the full article here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2024.105434\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 26, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew paper in EMNLP!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new paper on using large language models to mine large volumes of clinical trial data is now published. These models enable large-scale assessments of clinical trials, akin to a “data ocean” approach used in genomics, but specifically for clinical trial data! As always outstanding work, Simona! Read the full article here: \n\n\n\n\n\nOct 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew systematic review out: Diagnostic errors in multiple sclerosis\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his master’s thesis, Wolfgang Zürrer systematically reviewed diagnostic errors in multiple sclerosis, finding that such errors are common, with women being disproportionately affected. Excellent work, Wolfgang—keep it up! Read the full article here: https://doi.org/10.1177/13524585241274527\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTRIDE-Lab wins the University of Zurich 3R Awards 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n We are honoured to receive the UZH 3R Award, which recognizes our commitment to fostering the principles of reduction, refinement, and replacement in research. This award strengthens our dedication to promoting 3R at the University of Zurich and extending their impact to the broader scientific community.\nhttps://www.tierschutz.uzh.ch/en/UZH-3R-Award1.html\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful STRIDE-Lab summer school on systematic review in Bergen, Norway\n\n\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with Norecopa, we’re diving deep into the world of systematic reviews with a fantastic group of participants. Over four intensive days, we’re mastering the art of posing precise research questions, crafting detailed study protocols, conducting comprehensive literature searches, assessing risk of bias, running meta-analyses, and ultimately, publishing reviews. Systematic review is a cornerstone of evidence-based research, and we’re making every moment count with rigorous training, great discussions, and lots of fun! With very informative contributions on systematic literature searches by Cathalijn Leenaars and on systematic review automation by Simona Doneva.📖🎓🙏 A big shoutout to everyone involved for their enthusiasm and dedication, particularly Adrian Smith and Marianna Rosso.\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 23, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe won the 3RCC 2024 Award - yay!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are greatful that the 3RCC acknowledges our contribution to foster evidence-based and reproducible animal research. The 3Rs Award is given for exceptional work that has made a significant contribution to the Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement of animal experimentation (the 3Rs Principle).\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimona Doneva receives a GRC travel grant - congratulations!\n\n\n\n\n\nSimona Doneva obtained a competitive travel grant from the GRC at the University of Zurich. She will visit the OxML summer school on machine learning in health science in Oxford. Congratulations!\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 11, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur website is ready!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur website is officialy ready to launch and will be updated regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome Hanna and Vera!\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo new students join our lab from the computational linguistics department. Welcome onboard!\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 4, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
